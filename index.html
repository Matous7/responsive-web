                    Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant
                     strolls are scattered all over this planet;
                      you just need to know where to find them.
                       We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, 
                       Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out there,
                        waiting for you to walk all over them.
                         We’re proud of our record of successful
                          ascents (over 92% of our travellers make
                           it to the top of Kili, depending on the
                            route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides
                             that make the journey itself as memorable as
                              the summit. And if you’re not into big climbs,
                               don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact
                                walks and iconic treks you’ll love, too.

                        Leigh McAdam has been making my travel 
                        arrangements for about 20 years and there is no one else
                         I would trust to arrange my trips and tours. I've also 
                         had great  fun on a few of the group trips she has 
                         arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise 
                         out of Venice and diving. It's always an eclectic group
                          of well traveled, interesting people.
